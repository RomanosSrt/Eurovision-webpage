			<p class="history" id="history">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, originated as a technical experiment in television broadcasting. The concept of a live, simultaneous, transnational broadcast was groundbreaking in the late 1950s. The inaugural contest, held on May 24, 1956, featured seven nations: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy. Switzerland's Lys Assia won with her song "Refrain".<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Eurovision evolved into a week-long, technologically innovative spectacle. The idea for the contest was born from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), created in 1954 to facilitate cost-effective programming exchanges among European nations. Marcel Bezençon of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation proposed the Eurovision Network, but the concept of the song contest itself came from Italy's national broadcaster RAI, inspired by the Festival di Sanremo.<p id="participants"><br></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Eurovision Song Contest was held in Switzerland due to its central location and the EBU's headquarters. The contest initially featured songs performed in native languages, but as it grew, the trend shifted towards more universal lyrics to appeal to international juries. Rules have continuously evolved, including those on language, the number of performers, and the use of backing tracks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Eurovision Song Contest remains a dynamic and beloved event, drawing millions of viewers worldwide each year.</p>
